/// An output modality for Morse key state: sound, haptics, light.
///
/// Sinks are deliberately dumb: they only know whether the key is currently
/// down. Timing lives in [MorsePlayer] / the keyers so that every modality
/// stays sample-accurate with the others.
///
/// Contract:
/// * [prepare] must be awaited once before the first [on]. It may be called
///   again; implementations treat repeated calls as no-ops.
/// * [on] / [off] are synchronous and must be cheap: they run on the timer
///   callback that keys the element and are latency-critical.
/// * [off] when already off (and [on] when already on) is a no-op.
/// * After [dispose] the sink is unusable.
