# Adding a UI language to MorseCQ

MorseCQ ships English (`en`, template) and Simplified Chinese (`zh`) through
Flutter's `gen-l10n`. This page explains how localisation is wired end to end
and gives the exact steps for adding a third language, modelled on how the
sibling project toxee ships `ar` / `en` / `ja` / `ko` / `zh_Hans` / `zh_Hant`
(`/home/user/toxee/l10n.yaml`, `lib/util/locale_controller.dart`,
`test/l10n/arb_completeness_test.dart` there).

For day-to-day string work (adding a key, ham vocabulary) see [`apps/morsecq/lib/l10n/README.md`](../../apps/morsecq/lib/l10n/README.md).

> is: the `*_strings.dart` migration is finished (no English `static const`
> UI text remains and the one-off migration tool was deleted), the

## 1. How localisation works

### 1.1 gen-l10n and the `S` class

| Piece | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| gen-l10n config | `apps/morsecq/l10n.yaml` | `arb-dir: lib/l10n`, `template-arb-file: app_en.arb`, `output-class: S`, `output-dir: lib/l10n/generated`, `output-localization-file: s.dart`, `nullable-getter: false`, `format: false`. No `synthetic-package` (removed in Flutter 3.41; the key only warns). |
| Auto-generation | `apps/morsecq/pubspec.yaml` → `flutter: generate: true` | `flutter run` / `flutter build` regenerate; `flutter gen-l10n` does it explicitly. |
| ARB files | `apps/morsecq/lib/l10n/app_<tag>.arb` | One per locale. `app_en.arb` is the template and the only file that needs `@key` metadata (description, placeholders). About 660 message keys as of 2026-10-02. |
| Generated code | `apps/morsecq/lib/l10n/generated/s.dart`, `s_en.dart`, `s_zh.dart` | Committed, never edited. Exempt from the 500-LOC gate via the `**/l10n/**` pattern. |
| Access | `context.s` (`lib/i18n/l10n_extension.dart`) or `S.of(context)` | Below `MaterialApp` only; tests pump `localizationsDelegates: S.localizationsDelegates`. |
| Supported set | `S.supportedLocales` | Derived from the ARB files. `LocaleController.supportedLocales` and the language picker read it, so **no Dart list has to be edited to add a language**. |

`main.dart` wires:

```dart
MaterialApp(
  onGenerateTitle: (context) => S.of(context).appName,
  localizationsDelegates: S.localizationsDelegates,
  supportedLocales: S.supportedLocales,
  locale: context.watch<LocaleController>().locale,   // null = follow system
  localeListResolutionCallback: LocaleController.resolve,
  ...
)
```

### 1.2 `LocaleController`: follow-system or manual override

`lib/i18n/locale_controller.dart` is a `ChangeNotifier` provided by `AppScope`
above `MaterialApp`.

- `locale` is the **override** (`null` = follow the system). The Me page's
  `LanguageSettingsTile` (`lib/i18n/language_settings_tile.dart`) sets it.
- `effectiveLocale` is what the UI renders in right now: the override, or the
  OS preferred-locale **list** resolved against `S.supportedLocales` (see
  §1.3). The list is read live from `PlatformDispatcher.instance.locales`
  (injectable through the `systemLocales:` constructor argument for tests).
- Persistence goes through the `KeyValueStore` interface
  (`lib/i18n/key_value_store.dart`). Production uses
  `JsonFileKeyValueStore` on `<application support>/settings.json` (opened in
  `main.dart` regardless of which chat backend is selected, so the fake
  backend persists the language too; the desktop shell shares the same file
  through `DesktopStoreAdapter`). Only if that file cannot be opened does
  `main.dart` fall back to `InMemoryKeyValueStore`, which unit and widget
  tests also use. Key: `i18n.locale`; value: a tag produced by
  `localeTag()` — `en`, `zh`, `zh_Hant`, `pt_BR` (script wins over region).
  `parseLocaleTag()` accepts `-`/`_`, any case and legacy `zh_CN`, so an
  existing preference never needs a migration when a language is added.
- On restore, a saved tag is mapped onto the shipped set with
  `supportedLocaleFor()` (same-language, script/region aware). A removed
  variant therefore lands on a remaining locale of the same language — a
  saved `zh_Hant` becomes a manual `zh` choice in a build without
  `app_zh_Hant.arb`. Only a language with no shipped locale at all falls
  back to "follow the system".

### 1.3 One resolution rule, used three times

`lib/i18n/locale_resolution.dart` has two layers.

**The preference list.** `resolveSystemLocales(preferred, supported)` walks
the OS's whole preferred-locale list, most preferred first. The first entry
that maps to a shipped locale (by the per-locale rules below, without
fallback) wins; only when no entry matches — or the list is null/empty — does
English apply. A user whose OS lists `[fr-FR, zh-CN]` therefore gets Chinese,
not English: French does not ship, Chinese does.

**One locale.** `resolveSystemLocale(system, supported)` /
`supportedLocaleFor(candidate, supported)` are toxee's per-locale resolver
generalised so that the supported set is data:

1. A language with no ARB → no match (English as the final `fallback`).
2. Chinese: Traditional when the script is `Hant` **or** the region is
   TW / HK / MO with no script (Android reports `zh-TW` without a script, iOS
   reports `zh-Hant-TW`) — *if* a `zh_Hant` ARB ships; otherwise the
   Simplified file (`zh_Hans` if shipped, else plain `zh`).
3. Any other language: exact script match if shipped, else the language-only
   file.
4. Over the OS list (`resolveSystemLocales`): the first preference that rules
   2–3 map to a shipped locale wins; if none does, English.

`resolveSystemLocales` backs `MaterialApp.localeListResolutionCallback`
(`LocaleController.resolve`), `LocaleController.effectiveLocale` and the
context-free `currentLocale()` (which reads `PlatformDispatcher.locales`), so
the widget tree, the settings tile and a notification always agree.
`supportedLocaleFor()` is the per-locale rule without the English fallback
(also used to validate a user choice).

**Precedence.** An explicit choice in the in-app picker always wins. With
"System default" the app follows the OS preferred-locale list, and that list
already includes the OS per-app language (Android 13+ App languages, iOS
Settings → MorseCQ → Language), so the OS-level per-app setting works without
any native bridge.

### 1.4 The language catalog (native names)

`lib/i18n/language_catalog.dart::LanguageCatalog.nativeName(locale)` returns a
language's own name — `English`, `简体中文`, `繁體中文`, `日本語`, `العربية`, …
These are **not** ARB keys: an endonym is the same in every UI language (toxee
whitelists `english` as "legitimately identical to English" for the same
reason). The picker lists `S.supportedLocales` and labels each with the
catalog; only "System default" (`languageSystemDefault`) is a translated ARB
string. Lookup order: full tag → `language_Script` → language → the BCP-47 tag
itself, so an unlisted language still gets *a* label. `LanguageCatalog.isRtl`
is the layout-direction hint for `ar` / `he` / `fa` / `ur`.

The catalog is pre-populated well beyond what ships (≈35 entries) so most
additions need no catalog edit at all.

### 1.5 Strings without a `BuildContext` (notifications, tray)

`lib/i18n/current_strings.dart`:

- `currentS()` — the `S` instance for the current UI language, resolved on
  every call from `LocaleController.active` (set by `AppScope` for the app run,
  `null` in unit tests → platform locale). Same contract as toxee's
  `currentAppL10n()`.
- `lookupSFor(locale)` — `lookupS` that survives a persisted locale this build
  no longer ships (falls back to English instead of throwing in a
  notification path).
- `StringsResolver` (`strings_resolver.dart`) — a `ChangeNotifier` view for
  long-lived services (tray menu, persistent notification) that must relabel
  when the user changes the setting or, while following the system, when the
  OS locale changes. It is a `WidgetsBindingObserver` (`didChangeLocales`)
  and does not take over `PlatformDispatcher.onLocaleChanged`.

Notification texts (Android channel names and descriptions, "New message",
friend-request and group-invite notifications), the desktop tray menu and
tooltip, and the desktop window title all read `currentS()` /
`StringsResolver` (or an `S` handed in from it), so a new language reaches these OS-facing strings with no
extra work.

### 1.6 Reference content (Q-codes, abbreviations, mnemonics)

Reference *content* is data, not UI chrome, so it is not in the ARB files.
Each row of a reference table carries its text per language
(`lib/ui/reference/reference_localized_text.dart`). The lookup for a UI
locale tries, most specific first:

`lang_Script_REGION` → `lang_Script` → `lang_REGION` → `lang` → `en`

So a `zh-Hant-TW` UI reads a `zh_Hant` row once one exists and the `zh`
(Simplified) text until then, instead of dropping to English.
`kReferenceLanguages` lists the languages the tables carry (`en`, `zh`
today); `test/reference/reference_catalog_test.dart` requires every row to
have every listed language. Label separators use the full-width colon for
`zh` / `ja`.

### 1.7 What CI checks

| Check | Where | What it guards |
|---|---|---|
| `dart run tool/ui_literal_guard.dart` | `.github/workflows/analyze.yml` ("UI literal guard (localisation)"), `tool/test_pyramid.sh` gates | HARD gate. Parses every `apps/morsecq/lib/**` file (generated code skipped) and fails on a string literal containing a letter that is passed straight to a user-visible sink (`Text`, `TextSpan.text`, `Tooltip.message`, named `label` / `hintText` / `title` / `tooltip` / …). Exemption: `// ui-literal-ok: <reason>` at the end of the line or alone on the line above; the reason is mandatory and a stale marker fails. Prose routed through data maps or helpers is not seen — review still matters. |
| `test/i18n/arb_consistency_test.dart` | `flutter test apps/morsecq` | Enumerates **every** `lib/l10n/app_*.arb`: `@@locale` matches the file name, identical key sets, non-empty values, every template placeholder present, every plural has `other{…}`, `appName` untranslated, no `@@TODO` marker left, a fixed list of `error*` keys present in the template (the codes `lib/i18n/chat_error_messages.dart` maps; any other `ChatException` code reads `errorUnknown`). Every template key must also carry a non-empty `@key` `description` that does not point at a deleted `*_strings.dart` / `*Strings.` class. |
| `test/i18n/platform_locales_test.dart` | same | Native language declarations equal the ARB set exactly: Android `res/xml/locale_config.xml` (and `android:localeConfig` in the manifest), iOS/macOS `CFBundleLocalizations`, the iOS/macOS `*.lproj/InfoPlist.strings` set and their Xcode registration; every `NS*UsageDescription` translated in every language. ARB `zh` maps to `zh-Hans`, `zh_Hant` to `zh-Hant`, `pt_BR` to `pt-BR`. |
| `test/i18n/locale_resolution_test.dart`, `locale_list_resolution_test.dart`, `locale_controller_test.dart`, `language_settings_tile_test.dart`, `language_dialog_save_test.dart`, `strings_resolver_test.dart` | same | Resolution rules (single locale and preference list), persistence tags, picker behaviour, OS-locale relabelling. |
| `flutter analyze apps/morsecq` | CI analyze step | Generated code compiles; strict lints. |

gen-l10n itself **never fails on a missing translation**; it silently falls
back. A key missing from a base-language file (`app_ja.arb`) compiles to the
English template value. A key missing from a script/region variant
(`app_zh_Hant.arb`) is not emitted at all: the variant class only overrides
what its file contains, so the key inherits the base language (`zh`,
Simplified) — Traditional users would see Simplified text. toxee learned
this the hard way (ja/ko shipped ~110 English strings with a green build),
which is why its `arb_completeness_test.dart` exists and why the consistency
test here enumerates every shipped ARB and requires identical key sets.

## 2. Adding a language, step by step

Example: Japanese (`ja`). Replace the tag as needed.

### Step 1 — create the ARB

```bash
cd apps/morsecq/lib/l10n
cp app_en.arb app_ja.arb
```

File name = `app_` + the locale tag gen-l10n expects:
`app_<lang>.arb`, `app_<lang>_<Script>.arb` (`app_zh_Hant.arb`) or
`app_<lang>_<REGION>.arb` (`app_pt_BR.arb`). Set the header to match:

```json
{
  "@@locale": "ja",
  "appName": "MorseCQ",
  ...
}
```

### Step 2 — translate

- Translate every **value**. Keep every `{placeholder}` exactly as in the
  template (the consistency test checks each one).
- ICU plurals must keep an `other{…}` branch:
  `{count, plural, =1{1 session} other{{count} sessions}}`. Languages without
  plural forms (ja, zh, ko) usually collapse to
  `{count, plural, other{{count} 回}}` — keep any `=0` special case the
  template has.
- Leave `appName` as `MorseCQ` (product name, tested to be identical).
- The `@key` metadata blocks are optional outside the template; keeping them
  is harmless, deleting them keeps the file short. While translating you may
  mark an entry with `"description": "@@TODO(l10n): …"`;
  `grep -n '@@TODO' apps/morsecq/lib/l10n/app_ja.arb` lists open work, and
  the consistency test fails until none is left.
- Reuse the ham/Morse vocabulary consistently within the language (the zh
  glossary in `lib/l10n/README.md` is the model: dit/dah, character speed,
  Farnsworth spacing, sidetone, straight key, paddles, callsign, copy, send).

### Step 3 — display name in the language catalog

Open `apps/morsecq/lib/i18n/language_catalog.dart`. If your tag (or its
language code) is already in `LanguageCatalog._names`, nothing to do — `ja` →
`日本語` is there. Otherwise add one line with the **endonym** (the name in that
language, never translated):

```dart
'cy': 'Cymraeg',
```

For a right-to-left language add its code to the set in `isRtl`. Without a
catalog entry the picker still works but shows the raw tag (`cy`).

### Step 4 — generate

```bash
cd apps/morsecq
flutter gen-l10n          # writes lib/l10n/generated/s_ja.dart, updates s.dart
```

`S.supportedLocales` now contains `Locale('ja')`; the delegate's
`isSupported`, the picker and the resolver pick it up with no further edits.
Commit the regenerated files.

### Step 5 — verify

```bash
# repo root
dart run tool/ui_literal_guard.dart           # no hard-coded UI prose
flutter analyze apps/morsecq
cd apps/morsecq && flutter test test/i18n test/reference
```

Then run the app (the fake backend is enough:
`flutter run --dart-define=MORSECQ_FAKE_BACKEND=true`), open **Me → Language**,
pick 日本語, and confirm the shell relabels immediately. Switch back to
"System default" and set the device language to Japanese to exercise the
resolver path.

### Step 6 — reference content rows

Add the language to `kReferenceLanguages` in
`apps/morsecq/lib/ui/reference/reference_localized_text.dart` and give every
row of the reference tables (Q-code meanings, abbreviations, prosigns,
mnemonics) a text for it; `test/reference/reference_catalog_test.dart` fails
on any row that lacks a listed language. Until you do, the lookup in §1.6
shows English (or, for a script/region variant, the parent language's text).

### Step 7 — platform locale manifests

`test/i18n/platform_locales_test.dart` fails until all of these list exactly
the ARB set (BCP-47 form: `ja`, `zh-Hans`, `zh-Hant`, `pt-BR`):

- **iOS / macOS — `CFBundleLocalizations`** in
  `apps/morsecq/ios/Runner/Info.plist` and `macos/Runner/Info.plist`
  (currently `en`, `zh-Hans`). iOS only offers the per-app language in
  Settings for languages listed here.
- **iOS / macOS — `InfoPlist.strings`.** Add
  `ios/Runner/<tag>.lproj/InfoPlist.strings` and
  `macos/Runner/<tag>.lproj/InfoPlist.strings` translating every
  `NS*UsageDescription` key in the matching `Info.plist` (camera,
  microphone); the translation must differ from the English text and mention
  MorseCQ, and `en.lproj` must match `Info.plist` verbatim. Register the file as a new
  localisation of the existing `InfoPlist.strings` variant group in
  `Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` (Xcode: select the file → File
  inspector → Localization → tick the language) and make sure the tag is in
  `knownRegions`; the test checks both.
- **Android — `res/xml/locale_config.xml`.** Add
  `<locale android:name="<tag>"/>` to
  `apps/morsecq/android/app/src/main/res/xml/locale_config.xml`, which
  `android:localeConfig` in `AndroidManifest.xml` points at; it is what
  Android 13+ shows under App languages. The file is hand-written on purpose:
  AGP's `generateLocaleConfig` derives the list from Android `res/` and
  dependency resources, not from the Flutter ARB files, and would advertise
  languages the app has no strings for. If you later use
  `resourceConfigurations` / `resConfigs` to shrink the APK, keep the new
  language in that list too.
- **Windows / Linux**: nothing; the locale comes from the OS user profile.

## 3. Script and region variants (zh_Hant, pt_BR, …)

Follow toxee's precedent but keep it minimal:

- **Traditional Chinese.** Add `app_zh_Hant.arb` (`"@@locale": "zh_Hant"`) as
  a *complete* file — gen-l10n would silently inherit the Simplified `zh`
  text for any key it lacks (§1.7), and the consistency test rejects a
  partial file anyway. Keep `app_zh.arb` as the
  Simplified file; there is no need for a separate `app_zh_Hans.arb` (toxee
  has one only as an override layer, and its completeness test deliberately
  excludes it because gen-l10n resolves it through `zh`). The resolver then
  routes `zh-Hant-*`, `zh-TW`, `zh-HK`, `zh-MO` to `zh_Hant` and everything
  else Chinese to `zh` — no code change. `LanguageCatalog` already labels
  `zh_Hant` as `繁體中文`. Its native tag is `zh-Hant` (Info.plist,
  `InfoPlist.strings`, `locale_config.xml`); reference content shows the `zh`
  text until `zh_Hant` rows are added (§1.6). gen-l10n emits the variant as a subclass
  (`SZhHant` inside `s_zh.dart`) that overrides only the keys its file
  contains; that is exactly why a partial file would leak Simplified text.
  Write it as Taiwan Mandarin, not Cantonese colloquial (toxee's test rejects
  `咗嘅唔喺哋嚟冇揀`).
- **Region variants** (`app_pt_BR.arb`, `app_en_GB.arb`): gen-l10n requires
  the plain language file (`app_pt.arb`) to exist as the parent. The resolver
  walks the preference list, and for each entry rule 3 matches the script
  only — it does not look at the region, so a `pt-BR` device is not
  guaranteed the `pt_BR` file (it takes the first script-less `pt*` locale in
  `S.supportedLocales`). Extend `resolveSystemLocale` with a region
  preference (as it has for Chinese) in the same change as the first region
  variant.
  Persisted tags for region variants are `pt_BR` (`localeTag`: region only
  when there is no script).
- **RTL** (`ar`, `he`): Flutter flips `Directionality` from the locale
  automatically; use `LanguageCatalog.isRtl` only where a widget needs the hint
  outside the tree (tray menus, notification layout).

## 4. Checklist

- [ ] `apps/morsecq/lib/l10n/app_<tag>.arb` with `@@locale`, complete, placeholders and `other{}` intact, `appName` unchanged, no `@@TODO` left
- [ ] Endonym present in `LanguageCatalog._names` (and `isRtl` if applicable)
- [ ] `flutter gen-l10n` run; `lib/l10n/generated/` committed
- [ ] Reference content: language added to `kReferenceLanguages` and every reference row translated
- [ ] `CFBundleLocalizations` updated in the iOS and macOS `Info.plist`
- [ ] `<tag>.lproj/InfoPlist.strings` added for iOS and macOS (every `NS*UsageDescription`) and registered in both Xcode projects
- [ ] `<locale android:name="<tag>"/>` added to `android/app/src/main/res/xml/locale_config.xml`
- [ ] `dart run tool/ui_literal_guard.dart`, `flutter analyze apps/morsecq` and `flutter test apps/morsecq` green (includes `arb_consistency_test` and `platform_locales_test`)
- [ ] Manual check: Me → Language switch; system-follow with the device set to the new language; on Android 13+ / iOS, the OS per-app language setting with the in-app choice on "System default"
- [ ] Mobile parity: the Dart side is shared; the platform-specific steps are the plist / `InfoPlist.strings` / `locale_config.xml` entries above
