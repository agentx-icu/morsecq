/// - the [NotificationCenter]'s active conversation (no banner for what is
///   on screen), claimed with an owner token so a newer screen of the same
///   conversation keeps its claim when an older one goes away;
/// - marking messages read: only while attended, so a conversation left open
///   on a hidden tab, under a dialog or in a backgrounded app does not
///   swallow unread counts and banners. A read that could not be marked
///   (unattended, or `markRead` failed) stays pending and is retried.
///
/// "Attended" = its tickers run (visible shell tab, route not covered by an
/// opaque one), its route is the current one (no dialog or sheet on top)
/// and the app is in the foreground.
