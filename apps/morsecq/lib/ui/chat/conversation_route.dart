/// dialog's owner stays alive, and this is called again when the page is
/// rebuilt on becoming current / shown (both lookups register dependencies).

/// again right before it; the selection is forgotten only when the push is
/// made. The detail is not built on the frame that returns true, so the

/// composer then picks it up through the shared per-conversation draft
/// writer in `message_input.dart` (pending text wins over the stored draft).
